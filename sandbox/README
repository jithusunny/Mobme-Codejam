Problem
-------

Write a simple TCP server that supports the following commands:

    list - Lists all the files in the directory the server is running on.

    pwd - Print the path of the directory the server is running on.

    cat <filename> - Print the contents of the filename given as argument.

    rm <filename> - Delete the filename given as argument.

    touch <filename> <content> - Create a file with name and content given as argument.

    time - Returns the current time on the server.

Also implement a simple client program that uses this server. The client must create a file every minute on the server with a random filename and with the content being the current server time.
