Problem
-------
Write a program which when given links to two images on the Internet, finds out how similar they are.

Bonus points if it ranks images on a similarity scale from 0 - very different to 100 - exactly the same.


Solution Design
---------------
	The program uses Python Imaging Library(PIL) for image manipulation. The images are made even(resolution) & pixels are compared & difference is found out. The rms(magnitude) value of each of these difference is calculated to find out how similar the images are.


Dependencies
------------
Python 2.x


Usage
-----
$ python mirror.py
