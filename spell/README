Problem
-------
Write a spell checking program which checks an input text with help of an English dictionary. Remember: the spell checker is better if it manages to catch the most likely errors.

[Bonus points if you use cool data structures, like say, a Bloom filter]


Solution Design
---------------
	Bloom Filter is used to store and search the valid dictionary words in a time efficient way. UNIX dictionary is saved as 'dict' in the current directory itself.

Dependencies
------------
Python 2.x
python-dev
bitarray-0.3.5   	
pybloom-1.0.3-py2.7

Usage
-----
$ python spell.py
